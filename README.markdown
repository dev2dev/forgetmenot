Use cases:
You are going to a party to see people you don’t talk to often. Using basic information retrieved from Facebook and with what you already know, you use Mneme to quiz yourself on the people that you know are going to the party.

You are meeting a client for a business meeting. You have noted down information like the age of the client’s children and their names, name of the spouse, interests and what not. You buy a present for the kids with their names on it, and the client is impressed and you seal the deal.

•	Integrates with the address book and Facebook
•	Quiz mode that lets you select a range of people that you want to be quizzed on. It then gives you a factoid and four choices, which you need to pick the right person
•	Information is stored online under an account so if your device is lost, your information is not
•	Information is potentially shareable, ie for businesses.
